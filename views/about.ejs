                The efforts of NASA and SpaceX have successfully helped humanity establish a multi-planetary presence. In other words, humans have established both scientific and residential bases on Mars.

NASA's scientists have now agreed to *open the planet* to the public of Earth, and they are looking for 50 volunteers who would be aboard the next spaceflight to Marsâ€”the first one for tourism.

NASA expects volunteers from all over the world to apply for this highly selective and historic mission, and thus they want a robust platform through which they can connect with the applicants.
